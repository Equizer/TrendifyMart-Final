{/*                                  ALGORITHM FOR THE SELLER FEATURE FOR THE APPLICATION
// first i will let the user sign up then i would let the user chooose to be a consumer or to be a seller.
// so for that i have set the defualt value of seller to be false and the type to be a boolean so when the user signs in they are going to be just a user then in the profile sextion maybe i will give them an option to sign up to become a seller / partner to sell products oin the platform
//when the user signs up to become a seller i will get the user id fromthe local storage which will be stored in the auth-token then i will search for the user in the DB then change the value of the seller which was initially false to be true and then in my frontend i should have checks whether the user is seller or a consumer then we will decide whether to give the user certain features or not like CRUD product */ }
